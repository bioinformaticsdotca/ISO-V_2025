>Bioinformatics Analyst<br>
Princess Margaret Cancer Centre

Joan obtained her BSc and MSc in Biomedical Engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology in The Netherlands. During her studies she became interested in using computational biology/bioinformatics to study cancer. In the Winter of 2022, she moved to Toronto for a 6-month internship in the Gaiti Lab studying cell-cell-communication in glioblastoma using scRNAseq. After her internship, she stayed on in the lab as a Bioinformatics Analyst. More recently, she started to dive into the world of spatial transcriptomics to further study cell-cell-communication.

### Dina Karamboulas

>Research Associate<br>
SickKids

Dina is a Research Associate with the Miller/Kaplan and Frankland/Josselyn labs at Sickkids. She completed her PhD at UBC in Anatomy & Cell Biology. Over the years she has developed skills in computational analysis using scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, scMultiome-seq, Xenium and Merscope analysis to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the developing and adult brain.


### Savannah Kilpatrick

>Scientist III, Cell Therapy<br>
Genentech, gRED

Savannah is a stem cell biologist passionate about 3D tissue generation and its applications to cell therapy. Her postdoctoral research at the University Health Network (Toronto, Canada) examined cell-type specific alterations in neural circuit development and cell migration using patient-derived brain organoids and assembloids. She paired this model system with spatial transcriptomics including the 10x Genomics Visium V2 and HD platforms, where she identified migratory and regionalized deficits in neural populations. 

### Melanie Peralta

>Laboratory Manager<br>
Mount Sinai

Melanie is a registered Medical Laboratory Technologist and member of CMLTO in good standing. She has over 25 years of experience in Histology; 3 years in diagnostic Histology (Dynacare and Mount Sinai) and was team lead for the Pathology research program at UHN for 22 years. She has recently changed roles and has returned to Mount Sinai as Laboratory Manager for Mount Sinai Services.

### Yiyan Wu
